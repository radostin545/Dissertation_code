# Dissertation Code Repository

Welcome to the repository containing the code related to my dissertation! This collection of scripts was used to assist in various aspects of my dissertation research and analysis.

## Overview

This repository contains the following scripts:

- **fbm path simulation.pyy**: The code simulates paths driven by fractional Brownian motion.
- **fBm_simulation.py**: This code was used for plotting fractional Brownian motion for different values of $H$ showcasing the difference of the "roughness".
- **GMB_data_sim.py**: The code simulates Geometric Brownain motion realizations.
- **GBM_Supervised_NN.py**: Supervised Neural Network estimating GBM
- **GAN_GBM.py**: Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network used to approximate GBM
